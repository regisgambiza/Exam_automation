    "round1_summary": "Option A: Mean score = 77, Rationales: This option implies autonomy from external standards, which is a key aspect of an internal quality assurance system.; While schools have autonomy, a key part of quality assurance is aligning with broader educational goals and standards, not simply setting independent ones.; Setting own standards may conflict with Ministry's requirements.\nOption B: Mean score = 76, Rationales: Preparing a school development plan is often part of implementing an educational quality assurance system to set long-term goals.; School development plans are essential for outlining long-term improvement strategies, but they don't directly constitute the implementation of an internal quality assurance system.; Developing a plan is crucial for strategic direction.\nOption C: Mean score = 89, Rationales: Appointing knowledgeable individuals is crucial for establishing and maintaining a quality assurance system within the school.; Appointing dedicated individuals to oversee quality assurance is a fundamental step in establishing a robust internal system.; Expert involvement ensures effective system implementation.\nOption D: Mean score = 68, Rationales: The ability to adjust projects/activities as needed aligns with the flexibility required in implementing a dynamic quality assurance system.; Flexibility in project adjustments is important for responsiveness, but it's not a defining characteristic of a formalized quality assurance system.; Flexibility in annual plans might compromise quality assurance."
