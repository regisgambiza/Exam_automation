    "round1_summary": "Option A: Mean score = 66, Rationales: This option is not part of implementing an internal educational quality assurance system within a school because it is about setting standards independently without considering the ministry's standards. An effective quality assurance system involves aligning with national and international standards.; This option suggests that schools are free to set their standards without aligning with the Ministry's, which implies a system not necessarily under external control.; While schools have autonomy, a quality assurance system should ideally align with broader educational goals and not entirely disregard Ministry standards.\nOption B: Mean score = 81, Rationales: This option is relevant to implementing an internal educational quality assurance system as it emphasizes long-term planning and improvement. A development plan provides a framework for identifying areas of strength and weakness, setting goals, and allocating resources accordingly.; Developing a plan for years ensures systematic improvement and is directly related to quality assurance.; A development plan is crucial for outlining long-term goals and strategies, integral to a comprehensive quality assurance system.\nOption C: Mean score = 84, Rationales: This option is crucial to implementing an effective internal educational quality assurance system because it ensures that the individuals responsible for the system have the necessary knowledge and competence. Knowledgeable individuals can develop and implement policies and procedures that promote quality education.; Having competent individuals responsible shows commitment to effective management and implementation of QA systems.; Appointing dedicated individuals to lead the quality assurance process ensures ownership and effective implementation.\nOption D: Mean score = 70, Rationales: This option is not directly related to implementing an internal educational quality assurance system. While adjusting activities in the annual operational plan may be part of a broader quality improvement process, it does not involve the core elements of quality assurance such as setting standards, planning, and implementation.; Flexibility in annual plans doesn't inherently exclude the principle of quality assurance, but implies possible ad hoc adjustments that may not align with comprehensive QA criteria.; Flexibility in adjusting plans based on needs and feedback is a key aspect of continuous improvement within a quality assurance system."

It involves evaluating the school against national or international benchmarks.; Primarily focuses on school-specific assessments rather than external quality.; Focuses on internal school standards, not external assessment.\nOption B: Mean score = 66, Rationales: This option is partially correct as external quality assessment does involve monitoring and inspecting schools for feedback purposes, but it goes beyond just reflecting on educational management. It also considers evidence trails and adherence to central standards.; Reflects the main concept of gathering feedback for improvement through inspections and monitoring.; Closely aligns with the concept of external quality assessment as monitoring and inspection for feedback based on broader educational management.\nOption C: Mean score = 14, Rationales: This option is incorrect because building confidence among stakeholders is not the main objective of external quality assessment. Its goal is to evaluate schools against established benchmarks.; Timely but lacks focus on actual assessment methods or standards.; While stakeholder confidence is a potential outcome, it's not the core concept.\nOption D: Mean score = 52, Rationales: This option is partially correct as evaluating based on evidence trails and adhering to central standards are important aspects of external quality assessment.

However, it does not define the future direction completely.; Vision aligns with defining future direction for schools.; Vision often sets aspirational goals for the future and guides decision-making.\nOption B: Mean score = 46, Rationales: This statement is incorrect because a mission statement outlines the values and beliefs of a school as well as its outputs. It defines what the school aims to achieve rather than just specifying outputs.; Mission typically outlines both outputs and values.; Mission encompasses more than just outputs; it defines the purpose and values driving the school's actions.\nOption C: Mean score = 81, Rationales: This statement is partially correct because goals provide specific targets for the school to work towards. However, they are not necessarily future-oriented and can be short-term in nature.; Goals are indeed set for future achievements by educational institutions.; Goals are indeed specific, measurable targets that a school aims to achieve.\nOption D: Mean score = 54, Rationales: This statement is partially correct because identity refers to a school's unique characteristics and values.

A goal that requires creative solutions can lead to new ways of thinking and problem-solving.; Goals that require innovation inspire growth.; While creativity can be helpful, it's not the defining characteristic of a good goal.\nOption D: Mean score = 81, Rationales: A goal should be specific but not so specific that it becomes unattainable.
